This Git repository has been discontinued.

As of July 18, 2014, Apache configuration is directly managed within the
operations/puppet Git repository, specifically:

operations/puppet.git/modules/mediawiki/files/apache/sites

Please edit the Apache configuration files there.


Do you have a patch pending? 
---------------------------

It is quite easy to migrate it to the other repository, just ask for
assistance in #wikimedia-operations or to the ops list.

For one patch:
browse to modules/mediawiki/files/apache/sites in operations/puppet.git

git fetch https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/operations/apache-config refs/changes/88/146088/1 && git cherry-pick FETCH_HEAD
git review && git reset HEAD~1 --hard


For multiple patches you can modify the migraterepo.php script included in this repo.
